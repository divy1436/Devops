## Title

**From Zero to DevOps: My Practical Roadmap for 2025**

---

## Intro (Hook)

If you are confused about where to start with DevOps, this vlog is for you.

In this video and article, I will walk through a complete DevOps roadmap using real-world concepts like CI/CD, DevSecOps, Kubernetes, deployment strategies, and environments. By the end, you will know not just *what* to learn, but *in which order* and *why it actually matters* in real projects.

---

## 1\. What Is DevOps, Really?

DevOps is not just tools like Jenkins, Docker, or Kubernetes. It is a culture and a set of practices that connect three main things:

* Development
    
* Operations
    
* Automation across the software delivery lifecycle
    

The goals are simple:

* Ship features faster
    
* Reduce manual work
    
* Improve reliability and user experience
    

In DevOps, teams automate everything they can: testing, deployments, infrastructure, and monitoring, so software can move from idea to production in repeatable, predictable steps.

---

## 2\. DevOps vs DevSecOps (Why Security Is Not Optional)

DevSecOps is DevOps with security integrated from the beginning.

Instead of adding security checks at the end, DevSecOps:

* Shifts security left (checks start from coding and CI stage)
    
* Automates security scans in pipelines
    
* Treats security as a shared responsibility between Dev, Sec, and Ops
    

Tools you often see:

* Vulnerability scans: Trivy, Snyk
    
* Static analysis: SonarQube, CodeQL
    
* Secrets detection: Gitleaks
    
* Policy as code: OPA, Sentinel
    

In short:  
DevOps focuses on speed and reliability.  
DevSecOps adds security to that pipeline without slowing it down.

---

## 3\. My DevOps Learning Roadmap

This is the roadmap I would follow or recommend to anyone starting now.

### Stage 1: Core Concepts

Understand:

* What DevOps is
    
* Why companies use CI/CD
    
* Why multiple environments exist (Dev, QA, PPD, Prod)
    
* What deployment strategies are (Recreate, Blue-Green, Rolling, Canary, A/B, Shadow)
    

If you cannot explain these in simple language, do not rush to Kubernetes yet.

---

### Stage 2: Git and Collaboration

Before pipelines, you need Git.

Learn:

* git clone, add, commit, push, pull
    
* Branches and pull requests
    
* Feature branch workflow
    

This is important because almost all CI/CD pipelines start when you push code or open a PR.

---

### Stage 3: Build, Test, and Quality Gates

Next, learn how code is built and tested automatically.

Focus on:

* Build tools: Maven/Gradle (Java), npm, etc.
    
* Unit testing frameworks: JUnit, TestNG, PyTest, etc.
    
* Code formatting and linting: ESLint, Prettier, Checkstyle
    
* Code coverage with tools like Jacoco
    

Goal: Every push should trigger:

1. Build
    
2. Tests
    
3. Basic quality checks
    

---

### Stage 4: CI Pipelines with Jenkins or GitHub Actions

Now turn that process into a pipeline.

Key ideas:

* Pipeline stages: Pre-build, Build, Test, Quality, Security, Deploy
    
* Writing a Jenkinsfile or GitHub Actions workflow
    
* Triggering pipelines on pull request or push
    

Example stages in a Jenkins pipeline:

* Pre-Build: linting, secret scan with Gitleaks
    
* Build: Maven build
    
* Test: run unit tests
    
* Quality Gate: SonarQube analysis
    
* Security Scan: Trivy scan
    
* Docker Build and Push
    
* Deploy to Dev or QA environment
    

This is where you start feeling like a real DevOps engineer.

---

### Stage 5: DevSecOps Integration

Once CI is working, integrate security.

Add these to your pipeline:

* Static analysis: SonarQube, CodeQL
    
* Vulnerability scans: Trivy on filesystem or Docker images
    
* Secret scanning: Gitleaks or Talisman
    
* Policy as code: OPA or Sentinel for infra rules
    

Idea: The pipeline should fail if:

* Critical security issues are found
    
* Coverage or quality is below threshold
    

Now your pipeline is not just fast, it is also safe.

---

### Stage 6: Containerization with Docker

You cannot escape containers in modern DevOps.

Learn:

* How to write a Dockerfile
    
* Copying your app artifact (jar, node build, etc.) into an image
    
* Entrypoint and environment variables
    
* Multi-stage builds for smaller images
    
* Pushing images to Docker Hub or any registry
    

Example flow:

1. Build app using Maven
    
2. Build Docker image
    
3. Push image to registry
    
4. Use that image in Kubernetes or other environments
    

---

### Stage 7: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Now move from manual infrastructure to code-driven infra.

Learn:

* Terraform basics: providers, resources, variables
    
* Provisioning servers, networks, and managed services
    
* Ansible for configuration management
    

Goal: You should be able to bring up a full environment (for example, app server, DB, network) with one command using code.

---

### Stage 8: Kubernetes and GitOps

This is the heart of modern DevOps stacks.

Learn Kubernetes primitives:

* Pod, Deployment, ReplicaSet
    
* Service, Ingress
    
* ConfigMap, Secret
    
* PersistentVolumeClaim
    

Then:

* Use Helm to template your manifests
    
* Use ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps (cluster syncs state from Git)
    

Deployments become:

* Merge to main branch
    
* ArgoCD detects change
    
* Cluster updates automatically
    

You can implement rolling updates, canary, or blue-green deployments on top of Kubernetes.

---

### Stage 9: Environments and Promotion Flow

Set up a proper environment flow like this:

* Local: Developer laptop
    
* Dev: first integration environment
    
* QA: for testing and regression
    
* PPD (Pre-production/UAT): almost identical to production
    
* Prod: real user traffic
    
* DR: backup environment for disaster recovery
    

Typical promotion:

1. Dev completes feature → deploy to Dev
    
2. QA validates → move to QA
    
3. Business tests in PPD → approve
    
4. Deploy to Prod
    
5. If something breaks, rollback or switch to Blue-Green or DR site
    

This is how real companies avoid breaking production with every commit.

---

### Stage 10: Monitoring, Logging, and Feedback

DevOps without monitoring is guesswork.

Set up:

* Metrics: Prometheus
    
* Dashboards: Grafana
    
* Logs: Loki or ELK
    
* Error tracking: Sentry, New Relic, etc.
    

Alerts should notify you for:

* High error rate
    
* High latency
    
* CPU or memory spikes
    

In DevSecOps, also add:

* Security events and audit logs
    
* Runtime threat detection with tools like Falco or GuardDuty
    

---

### Stage 11: Putting It All Together

By this stage, your pipeline for a typical microservice will look like:

1. Jira story created
    
2. Dev creates feature branch
    
3. Code pushed, PR raised
    
4. CI pipeline runs: build, tests, quality, security
    
5. Docker image built and pushed
    
6. Deployed to Kubernetes Dev environment
    
7. After approvals, promoted to QA → PPD → Prod
    
8. Production monitored with dashboards, logs, and alerts
    
9. Rollbacks and deployment strategies ready if anything goes wrong
    

That is modern DevOps with DevSecOps built in.

---

## Closing

If you are starting your DevOps journey:

* Do not jump directly to Kubernetes
    
* Start with Git, CI, and automation basics
    
* Then move to containers, IaC, and Kubernetes
    
* Add security and observability as you go
    

In upcoming posts or videos, I can go deep into:

* Writing a real Jenkinsfile
    
* Setting up Trivy, SonarQube, and Gitleaks
    
* Deploying to Kubernetes using ArgoCD
